# flashchain
open-sourcing web3 games let's goooooo!!

the death of Adobe Flash has made me Very Sad and Despondent

therefore, I propose Flashchain: a way to revive Flash games but in a way that's better for both the devs and the players

## we require a payment model
devs need to get paid, but devs also need to understand the financial risk of distributing a game.

the current payment model is simple:
1) Devs put an upfront payment to list their game
2) Players pay one-time, recurring, lifetime, or exclusive fees to access these games

## players pay-to-play
you ever been to arcade recently? yeah most people haven't, and if you have, it's lacking in something...good games. (sorry arcades, but it's all RIGGEDDDD)

most people just want to sit at home for some reason instead of playing with friends at the arcade, so, we bring the arcade to the interweb and blockchain.

just like normal arcades, players gotta pay to play.

## why use blockchain
because it can facilitate payments without needing some company or government to sanction whatever it is we're doing.

also, processing global payments for global payers gets confusing. want to pay in KRW? USD? pesos? JPY? no one cares just pay in bitcoin lmfao

or pay in solana, or whatever else we support.

we don't get paid for this but you can tip the devs i guess

your money goes to the devs!

the devs who put up their $ to list their game puts money in a multi-sig wallet/contract that allows us to sustain the work, or collectively sponsor the devs/gamers. rise up

### Pros and cons of the payment model
Pros: Devs get paid whenever players pay to play their game. Cosmetics are optional and interchangeable between supported games, thereby co-supporting communities (and introducing tie-in sales)

Cons: Devs who list and don't get players risk their capital at loss. Big sadge. This causes removal of front-facing lists to prune them. (however, we'll keep it listed as long as the supporting file-based blockchain is available and if there are devs)

we encourage games to make their games open-source as this will reduce potential costs related to QA, model design, and other mods that go unpaid.
anybody who participates in these open-source procedures gets paid! wahoo!

# the Wanted Protocol
WANTED is the bounty board for Flashchain. it works a lot like bug bounty boards, except it's a work board. Accept Your Quest and get paid by the devs or the platforms (if we subsidize it!)

## will there be a DAO?
no. generally speaking, this concept is limited to a superminority/supermajority multi-sig, meaning multi-sig is necessary for sending out funds, and that number increases as it reaches supermajority (and then caps there)
